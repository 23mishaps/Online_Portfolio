<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>Spirtied away was one of the first Studio Ghibli movies I watched. I love the story and the art!</p>
<h3>Fried Green Tomatoes</h3>
<p>My coworker recently recommended this movie. I added it to my top list for the time being simply<br /> because it involves casual cannibalism.</p>
<h3>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</h3>
